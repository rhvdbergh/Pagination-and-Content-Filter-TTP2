This is the second project in the Treehouse Techdegree program. It is a pagination and content filter: given a list of students of any size, the page displays the students in lists of 10. Links to the next 10 students, etc., are displayed at the bottom of the page. The JavaScript calculates the necessary number of links and makes sure that the correct 10 students are displayed.

For extra credit, a search function has been added. 

The project makes use of progressive enhancement / unobtrusive Javascript techniques to make sure the correct info is displayed even if JavaScript is turned off in the browser.
